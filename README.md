# BasicMachineLearningModel
This repo show how to create and use machine learning models 
Here, we'll:

1. Create a basic model
2. Save it to disk
3. Load it from disk
4. Use it to make predictions about a dog who was not in the training dataset 


### Load the dataset

### Save and load a model
Our model is ready to use.Let's save it to disk.

### Time for predictions:

### Lets take 2 real world example :
> #### Case 1: Here assume that selected_boot_size = 31

> #### Case 2: Here assume that selected_boot_size = 32

In this exercise, we practiced:

1. Creating basic models
2. Training, then saving them to disk
3. Loading them from disk
4. Making predictions with them using new data sets
